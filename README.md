### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alexandr, a software developer with a focus on Android. Here are some of my notable projects:

## Primary Projects

### [Banking-App-Mock-Compose](https://github.com/alexandr7035/Banking-App-Mock-Compose)
This is my recent app created to practice developing a medium-size (~20K LoC) app using Jetpack Compose instead of Android Views and enjoy all Compose pitfalls :)

### [AffinidiID](https://github.com/alexandr7035/AffinidiID)
AffinidiID is a VC wallet app built for learning purpose. Created to dive into the technical aspects of **Self-Sovereign Identity** and **Verifiable Credentials** concepts using [Affinidi](https://www.affinidi.com) open APIs. The app was also created to pactice with Clean Architecture.

Actually, it's a native android client close to Affinidi wallet application but with the possibility to issue a test document.

### [GitStat](https://github.com/alexandr7035/gitstat)
GitStat is a simple Android app designed to aggregate Github profile data into informative cards and graphs.
That was the first app where I was practicing working with network requests and **GraphQL** in particular.
